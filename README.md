# Neural-Networks
Implemented Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and Multilayer Perceptron(MLP)

## MNIST Classification
Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) has been implemented to classify digits from MNIST dataset. Experiments have been done 
with Multilayer Perceptron(MLP), Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and Support Vector Machines(SVM) and their corresponding 
metrics have been recorded in report. Experiments have been carried out with different architectures(number of hidden layers, activation 
functions etc., kernels in the case of SVM) to see the impact on performance.

## Regression
Univariate time series forecasting has been used to perform regression over dataset of global active power values.
Active power values in the past one hour are used to predict the next active power value. Multilayer Perceptron(MLP) has
 been implemented. Experiment has been done using Multilayer Perceptron(MLP) as well as a linear regression model. Experiments have been carried out with different architectures(number of hidden layers, activation functions etc) and summarized in report.
